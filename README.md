  Welcome to our music platform.
 
 I am a front-end Developer and I always had a goal to create my own streaming platform. I am looking to collaborate with other dvelopers and work in order to bring quality result.
 
 How it suppose to work.
 
 This project must be able to get music from artist's and upload them to our platform. 
 We don't collect any information about artist's or listener's but we simply collect song information
